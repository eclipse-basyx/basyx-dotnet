# Welcome to basyx-dotnet-applications!

This repository contains off-the-shelf components ready to be used in your own BaSyx environment. They can be deployed on any infrastructure (PC, Mac, PLC, Embedded Systems, etc.) and hence built for various platforms (Windows, macOS, Unix, etc.). Of course these applications can also run on Docker and in the cloud (tested with Microsoft Azure).
